# Market-Entry-Analysis
## Description
This project focuses on predicting potential sales for ABG Motors, a Japanese car manufacturer, as they consider entering the Indian market. Using logistic regression on Japanese market data, a predictive model was developed to estimate purchase likelihood. The model was then applied to the Indian market to analyse the company's market entry

## Train
The model was trained using logistic regression using multiple linear regression on Japanese market data, incorporating customer demographics and purchase behavior as key variables.
